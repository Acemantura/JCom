# Bread and Butter
JCom started as an infantry first community, so we do what we can to support infantry, **including helping out our Infantry Squad Leaders as Fire Team Leaders**. The entire game hinges on support of infantry, as it is only infantry that can capture objectives.

### Minimum
Once our JCom SL is comfortable with his fire team leaders, _only_ then can we branch out to other squads, all while supporting our main Infantry Squad.

# Squad Composition
### Two Fireteams: Bravo and Charlie
The Main Infantry Squad should consist of 2 fireteams (FT), each able to operate independently of one another, so as to accomplish objectives by themselves and assist one another in larger engagements.

The Bravo element is primarily for, but not limited to, security, reconnaissance, and maneuver.  It will be the lighter of the two FTs in terms of firepower.

The Charlie element is primarily for, but not limited to, construction, base-of-fire, and logistics.  It is the support element.

### Basic Composition
| **Bravo** | **Kit** | 
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| FTL | Rifleman |
| Bravo | Medic |
| Bravo | (Light) Anti-Tank |
| Bravo | Variable |

| **Charlie** | **Kit** | 
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| FTL | Rifleman |
| Charlie | Medic |
| Charlie | (Heavy) Anti-Tank |
| Charlie | Variable |

### Fireteam Leader (FTL)
Each FTL should be a rifleman so as to keep the FT supplied with ammo, particularly the medic with bandages and AT with rounds.  For obvious reasons this helps the FT last longer in engagements.  The FTL is responsible for keeping the FT close together; cohesive.

### Medic
The Medic keeps their FT alive and healthy FIRST, and only helps others when the FT is stationary and only out of abundance.  The medic is ideally a dick, yelling at their FT and the rest of the Squad to space out.

### Anti-Tank (AT)
The AT member is often found much further away from the FT.  Reign them in.  Ideally the FTL will operate with the AT keep ammo ready and even draw fire away from the AT.

### Variable Kit
This kit will be decided either by the SL or by the FTL. 

# Logistics
### Standard Faction Loadout
Truck with 3000 logisitic capacity = 1200 Ammo / 1800 Build

A Truck with 2000 Logistic Capacity = 800 Ammo / 1200 Build
